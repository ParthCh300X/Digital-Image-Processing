# Hypothesis Testing – Critical Value Method (Z-Test)

This repository contains a Python implementation of **hypothesis testing using the Critical Value Method**, applied to a **left-tailed Z-test**.  
The example is based on a quality control problem involving the average lifetime of batteries.

## 📌 Problem Statement

A factory claims that the average lifetime of its batteries is **at least 500 hours**.  
A random sample of **36 batteries** is tested and the sample mean is found to be **485 hours**.  
The population standard deviation is known to be **60 hours**.

At a **5% level of significance**, the manufacturer’s claim is tested using the **critical value method**.

## 🧮 Statistical Details

- **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** μ ≥ 500  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** μ < 500  
- **Test Type:** Left-tailed Z-test  
- **Significance Level (α):** 0.05  
- **Population Standard Deviation:** Known

## 🛠️ Implementation

The Python script:
- Computes the **Z-test statistic**
- Determines the **critical Z value**
- Calculates the **lower critical value**
- Makes a statistical decision based on the critical region

The code is structured with clear steps and comments, suitable for academic submission and understanding.
