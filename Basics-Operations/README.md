# Basics Operation on Images

## Objective
To perform fundamental digital image processing operations on an image
using MATLAB, including grayscale conversion, color manipulation,
binary transformation, and histogram analysis.

## Description
Basic image operations form the foundation of digital image processing.
These operations help in understanding how pixel intensity values are
represented and manipulated in different image formats.

In this assignment, an input image is processed to obtain its grayscale
version, individual color channel information, black and white image,
and the corresponding histogram representation.

## Files Included
- `basics_operation.m` : MATLAB source code for basic image operations
- `basics_operation.pdf` : Published MATLAB report containing results

## Operations Performed
- Conversion of RGB image to grayscale
- Extraction and manipulation of color information
- Conversion of image to black and white
- Plotting of image histogram

## Methodology
1. Read the input image
2. Convert the image to grayscale
3. Perform basic color and intensity transformations
4. Generate black and white image
5. Plot the histogram of pixel intensities

## Tools Used
- MATLAB (Image Processing Toolbox)
