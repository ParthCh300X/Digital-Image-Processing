# Digital Image Processing

## Overview
This repository contains MATLAB-based implementations of fundamental
Digital Image Processing concepts. Each module focuses on a core topic
and includes the source code, a published report, and concise
documentation explaining the objective and methodology.

The work emphasizes conceptual clarity, mathematical understanding,
and structured implementation rather than reliance on built-in
functions alone.
